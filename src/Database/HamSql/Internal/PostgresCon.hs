= Implementation of Upgrades

Upgrades are tricky.

* DELETE statements must come first

== Tables

__TODO__: Delete tables and columns if the user excplicitly agrees to data loss.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS without any columns.

CREATE columns with their type on demand.

Always apply all ALTER COLUMN statments

* SET DATA TYPE
* DROP DEFAULT
* SET DEFAULT
* SET/DROP NOT NULL

__TODO__: Maybe bundle DROP/SET DEFAULT, such that they can't be reordered.

Constrs are completly dropped an recreated. Would be cool to create PKs
first, to fix FK requirements right away.

== Functions

Many things can depend on functions (column defaults, table and domain
constraints). Therefore, they should all be deleted before deleting a function.

Usually @CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION@ is used, such that no deletions occure.

However, some function properties cannot be changed via CREATE OR REPLACE. A
known example this the change of the return type. In this case the
'sqlErrInvalidFunctionDefinition' will be catched and the function is deleted
and created again.

== Domains

Constrs are always deleted an recreated.

Defaults are always set explicitly.

Domains are deleted on demand.

/The data type of a domain cannot be changed (at least in PostgreSQL)./

__TODO__: Issue error if domain type differs.

== Roles

Difficult since not schema qualified, but be have prefixes.

__TODO__: LOGIN and PASSWORD are not implemented via ALTER ROLE

__TODO__: Are role memberships revoked?

== Sequences

CREATE only defines name on demand.

Properties all via ALTER SEQUENCE.
