- Implement Parser.columnCheck
- Ensure that every module is only loaded once.
  Giving 2x the same module in setup.yaml
  can lead to strange errors
- Maybe a flag for strict parsing. Non-scrict turns
  error messages for unkown keys to warnings
- Maybe a flag for sloppy parsing. Erronouse objects
  are ignored and the next object is parsed
