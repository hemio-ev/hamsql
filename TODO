- Reverse membership for roles
  roles hould be able to join roles
  not the other way round
- Useful error messages if unknown keys appear
  -> include file name
- Maybe a flag for strict parsing. Non-scrict turns
  error messages for unkown keys to warnings
- Maybe a flag for sloppy parsing. Erronouse objects
  are ignored and the next object is parsed
- Post-Install code for modules, that is executed
  after all other install steps are done
